                Kondeshwar - Kondeshwar is a beautiful water fall along with a pond. There is a temple of Lord Shiva and hence the name Kondeshwar. Kondeshwar is remotely located away from noise and urban pollution, with the nearest village located about 20/25 minutes by walk. Though Kondeshwar is a very beautiful place to be in a monsoon period, there have been many accidents and fatalities due to unsafe swimming practices by people who have very less knowledge of the crevices under the water. Many people have died due to the turbulence of the waterfall and they were taken inside the crevices from where it is very difficult to come out due to the heavy force of water.
